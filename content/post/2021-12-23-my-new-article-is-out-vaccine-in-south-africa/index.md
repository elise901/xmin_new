As Omicron swept across South Africa, the question of vaccine distribution has been brought to our attention. In fact, the COVAX program has been delivering vaccines to lower income countries, yet some of them are left on the shelf to their expiration dates. Why? There is far more to be tackled than just "distribution". Health infrastructures, logistics, and vaccine hesitancy are posing a great challenge for the continent to vaccine their people.
