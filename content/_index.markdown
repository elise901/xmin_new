# Elise Li Zheng

## _Keep it simple, but not simpler_

I am Elise Li Zheng. Currently I am a PhD candidate at the School of History and Sociology, Georgia Tech. My interdisciplinary research focuses on the relationship between technology and health, especially the social impact of personal technology on both the practices and perceptions of health and fitness. My research looks at health and technology in China, as well as the social and political context of technological creation and practices. I am currently working on my dissertation on self-tracking and health technologies, exploring societal links between data, design, individual's life-worlds, and wider socioeconomic context. 

I went to college at Peking University majoring in Sociology and Political Science, and later finished my masters at London School of Economics. Before continuing my Ph.D. study at Georgia Tech, I worked in science communication as a well-established science writer writing in-depth pieces about technology and society for various media outlets in China. I am now writing as a free-lancing contributor on various issues related to science, technology and society. I receive AAAS EurekAlert! fellowship of International Reporters, and Kranzberg fellowship for technology studies at Georgia Tech.

When I am not doing research or writing, I enjoy museums, birds, national parks, and occasionally go rock climbing with friends.

My research primarily focuses on the personal technologies and its impact on health. I look at various kinds of wearables and the trends of self-tracking/self-quantification, and see how the design, human-machine interaction, collection of bodily data shapes the perception of healthy life.

I enjoy teaching and communicating with students. My mission is to inform and inspire more students (especially those of STEM majors) to think about the societal impact of science and technology, and to raise their awareness of social justice and human well-being. 

I teach various level from introductory courses to advanced seminars. I was trained in Center of Teaching and Learning in Georgia Tech and am working towards a teaching certificate. 

Courses I have taught or lectured a teaching assistant:

* Introduction to Sociology
* History of Medicine
* Sociology of Health and Illness
* Social Development
* Science and Technology Studies

I believe that the knowledge from the academia should be shared with the public with relevancy to the current and ongoing issues. I have years of experience writing for general audience about science and technology, and delivered public speeches and lectures on issues such as pandemic, health and inequality, technology use, etc. 

I write research and consulting reports for individuals or businesses on technological and societal impact and how to make sensible communications of them. Contact me for a quote. 

I also translated a few well-known books from English to Chinese, namely I Contain Multitude by Ed Yong, and Scientific Revolution by Steven Shapin.
